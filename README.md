# CriptoGiggles is a Password Encryptor and Decryptor 
## Turning Secrets into Giggles!

So, you stumbled upon this Python script, huh? Welcome to the world of password encryption and decryption, where developers sometimes encrypt their secrets with Base64 instead of, well, actual encryption! It's like locking your door with bubble gum — not very effective, but hey, at least it's colorful!

## Laughing Your Way Through Encryption

### The Encryption Dance

Ever wanted to see encryption in action? Now's your chance! Just run this script, type 'encrypt', and watch as your password does a little dance of encryption. It's like watching a magic show, but instead of rabbits, we've got bytes hopping around!

### Decryption: Breaking the Code (or Not)

Decrypting a password is like trying to solve a riddle after a night of coding — you never know if you'll crack it or just end up laughing at the punchline! Just type 'decrypt,' enter the encrypted password generated "by this script", and let the decryption magic happen. Who knows, maybe you'll uncover the secret to the universe! (Spoiler: it's probably just another password...)

## Developer Shenanigans: When Base64 is the New Black

Ah, developers and their quirky ways! Base64 encoding passwords instead of encrypting them? It's like trying to hide your diary in plain sight by writing it in invisible ink! But hey, who needs encryption when you've got Base64 and a sense of humor?

## Requirements: What You'll Need

- Python 3: Because why settle for Python 2 when you can have the latest and greatest?
- cryptography library: Because real developers know that encryption is no laughing matter (most of the time).

## Disclaimer: Laughs Guaranteed, Security... Well, Maybe

- This script is for entertainment purposes only. Don't use it to protect your nuclear launch codes in Israel or your secret stash of cat memes.
- Remember, folks, always use strong, randomly generated keys and follow best practices for password handling. Otherwise, your secrets might end up as the punchline of a bad joke!
